"""Modes and the environment each one materialises.

env.sh is the one switch table: `resolve()` sources the kit's `opt/forward/flashpairformer/env.sh` (ARM=E for "exact", ARM=T for
"fast") in a bash subprocess on top of the caller's environment and takes the delta — the same variables, values, defaults and unsets
the kit's own route produces, including env.sh's own probes (nvidia-smi compute capability; the prebuilt fast-LN for the
installed torch, selected from the kit's own third_party/fastln_prebuilt*/ directories). Two things are set here and nowhere
else: the kit README's per-(cc | triton) row switches around env.sh, and lazy init. PYTHONPATH is not exported: `stack.kit_sys_path()`
carries env.sh's entries into sys.path.

#     keep_pool); every other lever of the base is carried (the fused DiT token stack dit_fused + dit_lowp and pf_attn among them).
