"""Lever `pred_release` (EXACT, every mode): the previous item's prediction tensors leave the device before the
next item's forward.

The stock loop (`runner/inference.py` infer_predict in the pinned 2.0.0 tree) is `prediction = runner.predict(data)` ->
`runner.dumper.dump(..., pred_dict=prediction, ...)` (synchronous: the CIF / confidence JSON files are written before it returns) -> log ->
`torch.cuda.empty_cache()` -> next iteration. The local name `prediction` stays bound while the NEXT item's `runner.predict` runs, so item k's whole
prediction dict — coordinates plus the full-data confidence tensors, of which the PAE and PDE logits are two [N_sample, N_token, N_token, 64] fp32
tensors, about 2.4e-6·N² GiB — rides through item k+1's trunk, sampler and confidence head. Every multi-item process of every arm pays it.

The lever wraps `InferenceRunner.predict` (the core's fail-closed import-time patch, `opt_core.autoload.patch_attr_at_import`, like sampler_fuse):
at the entry of a call, the dict the PREVIOUS call returned (already dumped — the dump precedes the next predict in the one loop that calls predict;
a caller still holding the dict sees its device tensors replaced by None) has every CUDA tensor dropped and the allocator cache returned; then the
stock predict runs. Outputs are untouched (written before the release): EXACT, bitwise by construction. phase_timing wraps predict later (cli.py), outermost: the release is inside total_s, outside fwd_s.
Lines: the applied marker `PRED_RELEASE:armed|patched` (stack.MARKERS) and, per released item,
`[protenix-opt] PRED-RELEASE item=<previous item> released_gib=<x> padded_gib=<y> allocated_gib=<after>`.
The previous item's shared padded tri-attention sets (`ptx_trunk2_levers.release_padded_bufs`) leave at the same point, also after an
item that raised; sets a CUDA graph captured stay.
The TP line (--n_gpu P) runs one item per launch through its own entry: nothing to release there (the wrapper is inert, count 0).
Switch: PTX_PRED_RELEASE=1 (modes.PACKAGE_POST for exact and fast; big inherits its base's) — MODEL_OPT_LEVERS_OFF=pred_release removes it.
